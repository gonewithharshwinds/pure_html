## WHY PURE HTML? 

```PG-13``` ```No use of abusive words```

This repository holds pure, and holy html pages only. Why? The reasoning is as follows.

- You made a websie and think it's special. There's probably dozens of megabytes of javascript code running to sustain the "special" background effects you gave. All those parallax, appear, disappear, on hover, etc etc... Then your 40-pound jQuery making your project fatter. Not to forget the loads of polyfills which you're forced to add so that the older browsers and Internet Explorer get a turn on from your code to display a simple shadow. Why are you  simping for Internet Explorer so bad??? 


- Well, guess what? The PC was made to make life easier. and also know that "YA BORING"! YALL are only making it complicated, not just the code, but also your lives! So un-intuitive, isn't it? And you call yourself a genius.... Brag about being in "Computers" field, earning loads of bucks etc etc... Let me tell you. "YOU ARE LIVING A LIE". Today we have 2D websites! Soon, we will have AR/VR and 3D websites! Then what? 


- All those days that you wasted adding this functionality, or that functionality and finally you watch / you die before watching that your content is finally deleted in one blink of an eye. No one even cares or gives 2 damn about how heavy your project was, or what animation you added.
- Sad, it is......


## PSYCHOLOGICALLY SPEAKING --

- ALL THOSE HOT FEMALE MODELS will get your attention and waste your time. If you're a woman, you would probably be triggered to check her make up and what nots... If you're a guy, you'll be... doing the deeds if you're single ig... I don't care, eww. It's disgusting.
- BLACK & WHITE. THAT IS ALL YOU HAVE! No complexity. Variation is by size and weights of the font. You can easily figure out, especially since all those distractions are away.
- Faster work being done == you won't waste your time which is money, and money is what buys you food. Food makes you stay alive. HTML PAGES MAKE YOU LIVE!!! Bruhhhhhhhh! Why would you like to intoxicate yourself with some BS javascript and those animations that waste 1 second of your time per click! Oof!



## Solution!!!

> Presenting to you! The plain old refurbished HTML5, "The daddy of all web development languages". Why HTML?

- Lightweight
- Low carbon footprint 
- Fits on any screen
- Looks the same on any browser
- Accessible everywhere
- Old school ASCII art!
- Its responsive
- High contrast of Black and White, you don't have to add any weird container or background stuff to make visibility possible.... ugh! What a disgrace... Literally HTML websites are a boon for Colorblind people! Only Black, only white! Maybe images, who cares. I don't use images...

- Most of all  **IT WORKS!**

Its like the most perfect 150 year old single malt scotch and nothing like some "horse piece" that you call "whiskey",btw , spelt without an e...
